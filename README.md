# Starcounter.Core.Samples 

This sample will run without a prior Starcounter installation or database. It currently doesn't do much, as it's intended to simply show how to create a Starcounter.Core project, create a local database programatically and connect to it.

Install [.NET Core 2.1.4 SDK or later](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download), clone this repository and in the top level directory of the repository do:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
