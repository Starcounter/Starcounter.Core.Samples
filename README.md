# Starcounter.Nova.Samples

This sample will run without a prior Starcounter installation or database. It currently doesn't do much, as it's intended to simply show how to create a Starcounter.Nova project, create a local database programatically and connect to it.

Install [.NET Core SDK version 2.1.4 or later](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download), clone this repository and in the top level directory of the repository do:

```txt
dotnet run
```
