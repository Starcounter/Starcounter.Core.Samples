# Starcounter.Core.Samples

This sample will run without a prior Starcounter installation or database. It currently doesn't do much, as it's intended to simply show how to create a Starcounter.Core project, create a local database programatically and connect to it.

Install .NET Core RC4 and then:

```
cd Starcounter.Core.Samples
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
