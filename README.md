# Starcounter.Core.Samples 

This sample will run without a prior Starcounter installation or database. It currently doesn't do much, as it's intended to simply show how to create a Starcounter.Core project, create a local database programatically and connect to it.

Install [.NET Core RC4](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/rc4-download.md), clone this repository and in the top level directory of the repository do:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
